# Monitoring
Monitoring and observability setup scripts.

Planned:
- Log Analytics workspace
- Diagnostic settings for key resources (later enhancement)

The application is monitored using Azure Application Insights, providing real-time metrics such as request count, response time, HTTP errors, and data throughput.
